        "answer_cot": "Let's think about the multi-choice question step by step.\nI did get the correct answer within 80 seconds and it was not by luck either. I did not pick numbers but just used the concept stated by Ian.\nThe 3 numbers can be written as\na, (a + 2)(a + 4).\nIf 'a' is divisible by 4, then even 'c' or 'a + 4' is divisible by 4. However, is 'b' is divisible by 4, then both 'a' and 'a + 4' are still divisible by 2.\nA - (a + c) = a + (a + 4) = 2a + 4 = 2(a + 2) = 2q. 2q will always be divisible by 4 even if 'b' is not divisible by 4. Reason: 'q' already has a prime factorization of at least a '2'. Hence '2q' has two 2s.\nC - ac = a(a+4). If, as stated above, one of them is divisible by 4, then the product is divisible. If both of them are not divisible by 4, then the product is still divisible by 4 because of the presence of two 2s again in the prime factorization.\nD - qc/2 = (a + 2)(a + 4)/2. Either q or c is divisible by 2. Hence, if we assume that b is divisible by 2 and not divisible by 4, then it leaves us just one possibility. Is c divisible by 4? It has to be because c is the next consecutive even integer.\nE - aqc/4 = a(a + 2)(a + 4)/4. One of these integers is divisible by 4 already. If we again assume 'q' to be that integer divisible by 4, then we are left with the question - Is a(a + 4) divisible by 4? This is the same as option C.\nB - q + c = (a + 2) + (a + 4) = 2a + 6 = 2(a + 3). (a + 3) will never be divisible by 2 because it is an odd integer. Hence, 2(a + 3), although divisible by 2, will not be divisible by 4 because it has just one 2 in its prime factorization.\nAs a whole, whether you choose numbers (2, 46 being the easiest) or solve conceptually, The answer is still easily obtainable within 2 minutes.B",

The question asks for the probability of lasso-ing a cow AT LEAST ONCE in 5 attempts.\nWhen it comes to probability questions, there are only 2 things that you can calculate: what you WANT to have happen OR what you DON'T WANT to have happen. Those two fractions will always add up to 1. Sometimes it's much easier to calculate what you DON'T WANT and then subtract that fraction from 1 (which will give you the probability of what you DO want).\nHere, the work that would be required to calculate 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 lasso-ings of a cow would take some time and effort. It's far easier to calculate what we DON'T WANT (0 lasso-ings) and subtract that fraction from 1.\nThe probability of NOT lasso-ing the cow on 5 attempts is:\n(1/2)(1/2)(1/2)(1/2)(1/2) = 1/32\n1 - 1/32 = 31/32\nThe probability of lasso-ing a cow AT LEAST ONCE in 5 attempts is 31/32\nFinal The answer is \nD",

For the complementary case (senior partner was picked in the first 2 draws) you just take the complementary prob (1-1/3)= 2/3 and weight 10*9*8 with it.\nNow you just need to divide the answer (600) by the number of different positions (=3!) and get D=600/6=100B",

Lets also say that J rate = 10 miles/hour and K rate = 15 miles/hour.\nIf John stops at the 25% mark that means he travels 25 miles in 2.5 hours. It would take Karen t=d/r t=75/15 = 5 hours to reach john. If John had not stopped, their combined rate would 10+15 = 25 miles/hour meaning they would have met in 4 hours. Therefore, she ran one hour longer (25%) longer than she would have needed to if John ran for the entire time.\nThe answer is A 25%",

You can find f(1), for example, by plugging in 1 where x is, and you would get 12 - 1/2 = 11.5. Or we could find f(2), which would be 12 - 4/2 = 10.\nSo the notation f(2k) means that we are going to plug a 2k in for x everywhere in the formula for f(x). That would be:\nf(2k) = 12 - (2k)^2/2 = 12 - 2k^2.\nRemember that we have to square both the 2 and the k, to get 4k2.

Let's see if Brian could have won the race: if he ran at the fastest rate, he would complete the race in 2.5 hours, so combined time needed for Stephanie and Regine would be S+R=B+2=4.5 hours, which is not possible as sum of two must be more than or equal the twice the least time: 2*2.5=5.

I did not pick numbers but just used the concept stated by Ian.\nThe 3 numbers can be written as\na, (a + 2)(a + 4).\nIf 'a' is divisible by 4, then even 'c' or 'a + 4' is divisible by 4. However, is 'b' is divisible by 4, then both 'a' and 'a + 4' are still divisible by 2.\nA - (a + c) = a + (a + 4) = 2a + 4 = 2(a + 2) = 2b. 2b will always be divisible by 4 even if 'b' is not divisible by 4. Reason: 'b' already has a prime factorization of at least a '2'. Hence '2b' has two 2s.\nC - ac = a(a+4). If, as stated above, one of them is divisible by 4, then the product is divisible. If both of them are not divisible by 4, then the product is still divisible by 4 because of the presence of two 2s again in the prime factorization.\nD - bc/2 = (a + 2)(a + 4)/2. Either b or c is divisible by 2. Hence, if we assume that b is divisible by 2 and not divisible by 4, then it leaves us just one possibility. Is c divisible by 4? It has to be because c is the next consecutive even integer.\nE - abc/4 = a(a + 2)(a + 4)/4. One of these integers is divisible by 4 already. If we again assume 'b' to be that integer divisible by 4, then we are left with the question - Is a(a + 4) divisible by 4? This is the same as option C.\nB - r + c = (a + 2) + (a + 4) = 2a + 6 = 2(a + 3). (a + 3) will never be divisible by 2 because it is an odd integer. Hence, 2(a + 3), although divisible by 2, will not be divisible by 4 because it has just one 2 in its prime factorization.\nAs a whole, whether you choose numbers (2, 46 being the easiest) or solve conceptually, The answer is still easily obtainable within 2 minutes.B",

        "answer_cot": "Let's solve the multi-choice question step by step.\nFirst, let us say I have a number n which is divisible by 5 and by 7. We all agree that it will be divisible by 35, the LCM of 5 and 7.\nNow, if I have a number n which when divided by 5 gives a remainder 1 and when divided by 7 gives a remainder 1, we can say the number is of the form\nn = 5a + 1 e.g. 5 + 1, 10 + 1, 15 + 1, 20 + 1, 25 + 1, 30 + 1, 35 + 1 etc\nand\nn = 7b + 1 e.g. 7 + 1, 14 + 1, 21 + 1, 28 + 1, 35 + 1 etc\nSo when it is divided by the LCM, 35, it will give 1 as remainder (as is apparent above)\nNext, if I have a number n which when divided by 5 gives a remainder 1 and when divided by 7 gives a remainder 3, we can say the number is of the form\nn = 5a + 1\nand\nn = 7b + 3\nNow, the only thing you should try to understand here is that when n is divided by 5 and if I say the remainder is 1, it is the same as saying the remainder is -4. e.g. When 6 is divided by 5, remainder is 1 because it is 1 more than a multiple of 5. I can also say it is 4 less than the next multiple of 5, can't I? 6 is one more than 5, but 4 less than 10.\nTherefore, we can say n = 5x - 4 and n = 7y - 4 (A remainder of 3 when divided by 7 is the same as getting a remainder of -4)\nNow this question is exactly like the question above. So when you divide n by 75, remainder will be -4 i.e. n will be 4 less than a multiple of 75. So you must add 35 to n to make it a multiple of75\nThe answer is E",

        "question": "A vendor buys 10 t-shirts at an average price of $14 per t-shirt. He then buys 15 more t-shirts at an average price of $11 per t-shirt. What is the average price D per t-shirt that the vendor paid for these purchases?\nAnswer Choices: (A) $12.20 (B) $12.50 (C) $12.55 (D) $12.70 (E) $13.00",
        "answer_cot": "Let's think about the multi-choice question step by step.\nCorrect The answer is A\nExplanation: The relevant formula for this problem is Average D= (Sum)/(Number of Terms). Another way to look at the formula is Sum = Average x Number of Terms. For the first purchase, the vendor's sum (total cost) was $140, since 14 x 10 = 140. For the second purchase, the vendor's cost was $165, since 11 x 15 = 165. The grand sum is then $140 + $165, which equals $305. The total number of shirts purchased was 25, so to get the average price per shirt, we divide 305 by 25, which equals $12.20. As a result, the correct answer is A.\nNOTE: A relative understanding of weighted average offers a shortcut to this problem. Because the true average of 11 and 14 is 12.5, but the vendor sells more shirts at the lower price than at the higher price, the weighted average must be less than $12.50; only answer choice A is a possibility.",

We need r to be maximum so k and m should be as small as possible to get the average of 16. Since all the numbers are positive integers, k and m cannot be less than 1 and 2 respectively. 1 is 15 less than 16 and 2 is 14 less than 16 which means k and m combined are 29 less than the average. 30 is already 14 more than 16 and hence we only have 29 - 14 =15 extra to distribute between r and s.

        "answer_cot": "800score Official The first step to solving this problem is to actually graph the two lines. The lines intersect at the point (-4, -4) and form a right triangle whose base length and height are both equal to 4. As you know, the area of a triangle is equal to one half the product of its base length and height: A = (1/2)bh = (1/2)(4 × 4) = 8; so z = 8.\nThe next step requires us to find the length of a side of a cube that has a face area equal to 8. As you know the 6 faces of a cube are squares. So, we can reduce the problem to finding the length of the side of a square that has an area of 8. Since the area of a square is equal to s², where s is the length of one of its side, we can write and solve the equation s² = 8. Clearly s = √8 = 2√2 , oranswer choice D.",

        "answer_cot": "Let's think about the multi-choice question.\nExplanations:\n1. Rolling any number on a dice three times in a row is equal to the number of throws {{1/6}^3}*6 = 1/36, where 3 represents the number of throws and 6 is the number of different ways to get three of the same number (e.g. 1, 1, 1 2, 2, 2 3, 3, 3…).\nNext we have to use the combinations formula to determine how many ways three out of five can be the same. {5!}/{3!*2!}=10. We want to multiply this number to {1/36}*10=10/36\nWe are not finished yet – there is one little twist to the problem. The question says “exactly three times.” Meaning we have to discount all the instances in which we roll the same number four times and those instance in which we roll the same number five times.\nOne way to do so is by multiplying by the probability that the fourth and fifth dice will NOT land on the same number as the three dice. Because there are five other possibilities on dice that will not compromise “exactly three numbers” we can multiply by {5/6{*{5/6}=25/36\nFinally this gives us {10/36}*{25/36}={125/648}\nThe answer is D",

If vehicles must clear the top of the tunnel by at least ½ foot when they are inside the traffic lane, what should be the limit L on the height of vehicles that are allowed to use the tunnel?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 5½ ft (B) 7½ ft (C) 8 ½ ft (D) 9½ ft (E) 10 ft",
        "answer_cot": "Let's label the midpoint of the circle O. Since the base of the semi-circle is 20, we know that the diameter is 20 and, accordingly, the radius is 10.\nWe also know that the traffic lane is 12 feet long and there's an equal amount of space on either side, so the traffic lane extends 6 feet on either side of O. Let's call the leftmost point on the base of the traffic lane A. So, the distance OA is 6.\nNow draw a line straight up from A to the top of the tunnel. Let's label the point at which the line intersects the circle B. The answer to the question will, therefore, be the height AB - .5 feet (we need to leave .5 feet of clearance).\nHere's the key to solving the question: if we draw a line from O to B, that line is a radius of the circle and, therefore, has length 10. We now have right triangle OAB (the right angle is at pointA, with leg OA=6 and hypotenuse OB=10. We can now solve for leg AB=8 (either by applying the pythagorean theorum or by applying the 3/4/5 special right triangle ratio).\nFinally: AB=8, so the correct answer L is 8 - .5 = 7.5... choose B!",

        "answer_cot": "Let's think about the multi-choice question step by step.\nThe question asks aboutthe largest positive integer that MUST divide n, not COULD divide n. Since the least value of n for which n^2 is a multiple of 72 is 12 then the largest positive integer that MUST divide n is 12.\nComplete solution of this question is given above. Please ask if anything remains unclear.\nI spent a few hours on this one alone and I'm still not clear. I chose 12 at first, but then changed to 48.\nI'm not a native speaker, so here is how I interpreted this question:the largest positive integer that must divide n=the largest positive factor of n. Since n is a variable (i.e. n is moving), so is its largest factor. Please correct if I'm wrong here.\nI know that if n = 12, n^2 = 144 = 2 * 72 (satisfy the condition). When n = 12, the largest factor of n is n itself, which is 12. Check: 12 is the largest positive number that must divide 12 --> true\nHowever if n = 48, n^2 = 48 * 48 = 32 * 72 (satisfy the condition too). When n = 48, the largest factor of n is n itself, which is 48. Check: 48 is the largest positive number that must divide 48 --> true\nSo, I also notice that the keyword isMUST, notCOULD. The question is, why is 48 notMUST divide 48, but instead onlyCOULD divide 48? I'm not clear right here. Why is 12MUST divide 12? What's the difference between them?\nOnly restriction we have on positive integer n is that n^2 is divisible by 72. The least value of n for which n^2 is divisible by 72 is 12, thus nmustbe divisible by 12 (n is in any case divisible by 12). For all other values of n, for which n^2 is divisible by 72, n will still be divisible by 12. This means that n is always divisible by 12 if n^2 is divisible by 72.\nNow, ask yourself: if n=12, is n divisible by 48? No. So, n is not always divisible by 48.\nThe answer is B",
